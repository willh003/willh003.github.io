Traditional code coverage metrics, like branch and line coverage, can miss dangerous combinations of inputs to a program. Combinatorial testing is a method for covering the input space of a program, but it had not previously been investigated in the context of state-machine based systems, such as those used for flight control software. I developed a tool that automatically generates tests for these systems with a specified degree of combinatorial coverage.
