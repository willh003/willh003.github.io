Traditional code coverage metrics, like branch and line coverage, can miss dangerous combinations of inputs to a program. Combinatorial testing is a method for covering the input space of a program. I developed a tool that automatically generates tests for state-based systems with a specified degree of combinatorial coverage. The tool was used to analyze and improve coverage of flight control software.
