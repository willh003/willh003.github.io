To learn from a single video, current approaches leverage an image encoder, distance metric on the encoder's latent space, and distribution-matching algorithm to produce dense rewards for RL. We prove that frame-level distribution matching algorithms cannot accurately model the ground truth reward of a video demonstration. We propose ORCA (ORdered Coverage Alignment), a principled and intuitive algorithm that achieves better performance on 16 video-imitation tasks in two simulation environments.
