We show that existing approaches for inferring reward functions from video demonstrations result in temporal inconsistencies: agents complete subtasks in the wrong order, get stuck along the expert trajectory, or fail to stay in the final state. Our approach mitigates this problem, solving humanoid control tasks quickly and efficiently.
